## RareMobTracker 1.19 Fabric

The starting point for anyone enthusiastic in porting the mod over.

This repository has been set to public at May 15th 2025 to give newrising developers a general 
direction as to where to start implementing their own RareMobTracker.

For any issues, you may reach out to me! I'm happy to give pointers and directions on where to go if stuck,
but for any problems you encounter is yours, I won't be helping you out on that.

## General outline on all implementations

- Listen to entity creation/load events
- Get entity name
- Check if rare mob (either the tag or by name)
- - Optional: Add a whitelist for mobs you are interested in but is not a rare mob!
- Process it accordingly!
